## Here are some important things I learned 
- I learned it not everything online is the cloud. The question in one of the assignenments threw me because I thought everything online is the cloud. My brain still thinks about IT the way it was 20 years ago. 

### WEEK 2 - CLOUD COMPUTING

#### Brief History
Idea of computing in a "cloud" traces back to the orgins of utility computing

-John McCarthy (1961) 
>*"...computing may someday be organized as a public utility*>

-Leonard Kleinrock (1959) chief scientist at ARPANET (Advanced Research Projects Agency Network, project that seeded the internet 
>*"As of now, computer netowrks are still in their infancy, but as they grow up and become sophisticated, we will probably see the spread of "computer utilities"*>

Public had been using Internet-based computer utlities since the mid-1990's
- Search engines/emails = Yahoo!/Google
- Open public platforms = MySpace/FB/YouTube
- Social media = Twitter/IG
- Late 90's - Salesforce.com - pioneered the notion of bringing remotely provisional services
     - 2002 -Amazon.com launched Amazon Web Services (AWS)

Evolution of the term "cloud"
- early 1990's - the networking method at this point suupported the transmission of data from one end-point (local network) to the "cloud" (wide area network) and then further decomposed to another intended end-point
- 2006 - term "cloud computing" emerged in the commercial arena. 
       - Amazon = Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) services - enabled org to lease computing capacity and processing power to run their enterprice applications
       - Goog Apps 
       - Google App Engine
 
 Then new formal definition by Gartner 
 >...a style of compujting in which scalable and eastic IT-enabled capabilities are delivered as a service to external customers using Internet technologies.
 
#### *2.2 Business Drivers*
- shaped clouds and the overall cloud computing market from both ends
- motivated orgs to adopt cloud computing
- motivated other orgs to provide cloud computing environments and cloud tech venders in order to create and meet the demand to fulfill consumer needs

##### Capacity Planning
- the process of determining and fulfilling future demands of an org's IT resources, products, and services. 
- max amount of work that an IT resource is capable of delivering in a given period of time
- discrepency  = over-provisioning or under-provisioning
- Planning stratagies
     - Lead Strategy - adding capacity to an IT resource in anticipation of demand
     - Lag Strategy - adding capacity when the IT resource reaches its full capacity
     - Match Strategy - adding IT resource cpacity in smal increments, as demand increases
 
##### Cost Reduction

##### Organizational Agility
